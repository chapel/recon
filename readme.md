# Recon

The start of a Battlefield 3 server remote control panel. At the time of it's writing, the RCON binary API was fully functional.

### Purpose

I wrote this with the intention of creating a remote control panel for BF3 servers when I was actively playing. I did not finish that original goal, but had a somewhat functional BF3 RCON binary API that I could use to parse and or interact with a BF3 server using Node.js.

This is on Github for historical reasons. **Use at your own risk.**
